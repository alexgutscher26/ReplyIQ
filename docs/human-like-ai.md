# Human-like AI Model

This feature enhances AI-generated text to sound more natural and human-like by adding various linguistic features that make the text less predictable and more similar to human writing.

## Features

- **Filler Words**: Adds natural-sounding filler words like "um", "uh", "you know", etc.
- **Grammatical Variations**: Introduces natural variations in grammar and punctuation
- **Natural Pauses**: Adds pauses using ellipsis and dashes for more natural flow
- **Configurable Settings**: Fine-tune the level of human-like behavior

## How It Works

The human-like model is a wrapper around existing AI models that:
1. Takes the output from a base model (e.g., GPT-4, Mistral, Gemini)
2. Applies various transformations to make the text more human-like
3. Returns the enhanced text

## Configuration

### Model Selection

1. Go to Settings > General > AI Model Settings
2. Select a human-like model from the dropdown:
   - Human-like GPT (based on GPT-4)
   - Human-like Mistral (based on Mistral Small)

### Human-like Settings

When a human-like model is selected, additional settings become available:

- **Response Variation (Temperature)**: Controls the randomness of the output
  - Lower values (0.1-0.5): More focused and deterministic
  - Higher values (0.6-1.0): More creative and varied

- **Response Diversity (Top P)**: Controls the diversity of the response
  - Lower values (0.1-0.5): More focused and on-topic
  - Higher values (0.6-1.0): More diverse and creative

- **Filler Words**: Toggle to add natural filler words
- **Grammatical Variations**: Toggle to add natural grammar variations
- **Natural Pauses**: Toggle to add natural pauses in the text

## Best Practices

1. **Start with defaults**: The default settings are optimized for most use cases
2. **Test different models**: Try different base models to see which works best for your needs
3. **Adjust temperature**: If responses are too random, try lowering the temperature
4. **Monitor output**: Review the output to ensure it meets your quality standards

## Troubleshooting

### The text doesn't sound natural enough
- Try increasing the temperature slightly
- Ensure "Filler Words" and "Grammatical Variations" are enabled
- Consider adjusting the system prompt to encourage more natural language

### The text is too informal
- Lower the temperature for more focused responses
- Disable some of the human-like features if they're too aggressive
- Adjust the system prompt to specify the desired tone

### Performance is slow
- Human-like processing adds a small overhead
- For faster responses, try disabling some features
- Consider using a more powerful base model

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Create a human-like model wrapper
const humanLikeModel = new HumanLikeModelWrapper(baseModel, {
  temperature: 0.7,
  topP: 0.9,
  addFillerWords: true,
  addGrammaticalVariations: true,
  addPauses: true,
});

// Generate text
const response = await humanLikeModel.generateText("Tell me a story");
```

## Limitations

- The human-like transformations are applied after the base model generates text
- Some features may not work well with all languages
- The effectiveness depends on the quality of the base model
